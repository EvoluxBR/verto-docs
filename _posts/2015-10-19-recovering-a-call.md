What happens if:

- your internet connection goes down for a while
- your browser closes or you close the tab by mistake
- your computer restarts, shuts down, have a power failure

Verto **automatically** restore current calls with no user interference. 

You can just test it now. Open the Verto demo application we've just did and make a call. Then reload its browser tab and see the magic happening.

Go tell your friends. Invite them to the Verto community!
